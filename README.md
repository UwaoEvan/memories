# memories
This is a Full Stack MERN application called memories.
For now:-
1. Anyone can create his/her memories by just filling up the form provided in the app.
2. Anyone can edit any of the memories in the app.
3. Anyone can like any of the memories.
4. Anyone can delete any of the memories.

It is still under development and i'm yet to add user authentication so that i can limit some permissions to the users of the app.

Visit https://memories-crud.netlify.app/ to view the app.
Visit https://memories-crud.herokuapp.com/ to interact with the API.
